## Project Description 🌐​

Hi, this is a little project I did during the first semester of this year at university. I did it for practice and a bit for fun. The code still needs to be fixed and refined, as I haven't had much time due to studying and other things. 
Anyway, about the project: The project is based on the use of sockets (one for the server and the various clients). The server can connect up to 10 clients (just create the "client_n .c" file [and updating the CMake file]. 
You can see how it works in the video above
